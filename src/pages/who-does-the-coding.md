> What is wanted in the long run, of course, is the man with the problem does the actual writing of the code with no human interface, as we all too often have these days, between the person who knows the problem and the person who knows the programming language. This date is unfortunately too far off to do much good immediately, but I would think by the year 2020 it would be fairly universal practice for the expert in the field of application to do the actual program preparation rather than have experts in computers (and ignorant of the field of application) do the progam preparation.

This quote was written in 1995, 25 years ago. Since we are now in 2020, it is worth thinking about more. There are glimpses of this being true; the "shortcuts" on iPhone, roam research on the web, perhaps one could think of excel as writing code. Yet, I believe we are still ten years out at least from the reality of having the **person with the problem doing the code's actual writing**. As someone who writes code as a hobby, many days, I think of how much better, how much easier my life could be if I could write some code to do an aspect of my job, tey this is far from possible.

As an internal medicine doctor, I use a computer all day long. The main software I use on the computer is a remote desktop running an electronic medical record, Cerner. My company, a relatively small medical provider, has a team of between 20 - 100 IT staff whose main job is to support Cerner. A doctor's ability to write software to improve their lives is severely limited at this time, even if one knows how to write it. If you write it, you are not allowed to run it.

If I had to pick one of the most frustrating aspects of the practice of medicine to myself today, it would be this simple fact. I work in information all day long. Computers are masterful managers of information. The information is strangled and suffocated by being locked within the rigid software framework, the electronic medical record.

If only we were given robust APIs on top of a standard package on which to do our jobs and left to build and share creations on our own, the practice of internal medicine would be accelerating much faster than in currently is. We could create workflows for medical problems, and safety checks for everyday occurrences instead of having such programs handed down to us by the IT staff. With a robust set of APIs, perhaps the underlying medicine would remain the same, but the quality of the practice of medicine would advance by order of magnitude.
